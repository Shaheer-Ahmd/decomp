This project provides a framework built on Clang and LLVM-CBE that enables more faithful and human-readable conversion of LLVM IR files back to C code. By attaching metadata to IR during Clang compilation and leveraging it during the decompilation process in LLVM-CBE, we enhance the readability and structure of the generated C code. This empowers developers to safely debloat binaries while retaining a usable, auditable C representation for analysis, debugging, and sharing.
